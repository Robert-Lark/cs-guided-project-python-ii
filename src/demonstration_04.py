Challenge #4:

Create a function that changes specific words into emoticons. Given a sentence
as a string, replace the words `smile`, `grin`, `sad`, and `mad` with their
corresponding emoticons.

word -> emoticon
---
smile -> :D
grin -> :)
sad -> :(
mad	-> :P

Examples:
- emotify("Make me smile") ➞ "Make me :D"
- emotify("Make me grin") ➞ "Make me :)"
- emotify("Make me sad") ➞ "Make me :("

Notes:
- The sentence always starts with "Make me".
- Try to solve this without using conditional statements like if/else.

    emojis = {"smile": ":)", "grin": ":D", "sad": ":(" }
    return "Make me" + emojis[txt.split(" ")[2]]
print(emotify("Make me sad"))
